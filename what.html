I build a lot of things, always have, and generally from recycled materials. I enjoy the process, the conceptualisation and construction. Creating something interesting yet practical out of <span style="color:black">discarded things.</span>

        <p class="hometext">I spent a lot of time in the garage as a kid. Garage a loose term, as there was no way a car would fit... it was full of stuff collected by my dad on the justification 'that'll be useful someday'. And it was. Coupled with things I learned from him, and my own lessons, I would tinker with the stuff. Find things and envision something for it. Or be looking for something to fit a purpose but just not sure exactly what. My dad also taught me about what things were and did, many pretexted with 'did you know that was a...' frustrated, as he held it up in its new transformed state.

        <p class="hometext">Just over 2 years ago in the old garage cleanout, a few oddments inspired me to build another lamp. It quickly turned to a focus, contributed to by many factors. Prompted by a desire to create new longevity. All detail is considered, its usability, the reuse, repair and refashion, right down to mainly recycled fasteners.
