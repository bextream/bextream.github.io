        <p class="hometext">I spent a lot of time in the garage as a kid. It was full of stuff collected by my dad, justified by 'that'll be useful someday'. And a lot of it has been. Combined with things I learned from him, and my own experiments, I would tinker among the stuff. Find things and envision something for it. Or look for something to fit a purpose, but not sure exactly what will turn up.

        Just over 2 years ago in the old garage cleanout, a few oddments inspired me to build some lamp. Prompted by a desire to create, I began this current body of work. It's been a lot of work but all enjoyable and I hope you will enjoy them equally. I dedicate this exhibition to my Dad. I also thank the Bower and Reverse Garbage at Addison Road for being great resources for 'stuff'.
